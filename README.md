# Marketplace for Noble charitable Deeds

A blockchain-based financial system for charity organizations offers a transparent, secure, and immutable way to track donations and spending. By leveraging blockchain technology, every transaction is permanently recorded on a decentralized ledger, preventing any alteration or misuse of funds

Also creating custom smartcontracts that allow you to mint your nft NFT of the charitable work the client does, giving him rights over the nobel wrok, by making a secure immutable digital asset of the digital records of Act.


## Roadmap

- Select a blockchain network

- Develop smart contracts

- Develop a De-centralized Host application, for providing services

- Develop a Market place

- Develop a Digital wallet

- Deploy the smart-contracts on everything

- Create a Dapp to host everything on internet

- (optional) Allow other blockchain networks to exchange tokens


## Selection of public Blockchain

To mint NFTs, you generally need a public blockchain because NFTs thrive on decentralization, transparency, and immutability. Public blockchains allow anyone to participate, mint, buy, and sell NFTs while ensuring security and transparency

Recommended Features for NFT Minting:

- Smart Contract Support: Blockchains must support programmable smart contracts (e.g., Ethereum, Solana).

- NFT Standards: Compatible with standards like ERC-721, ERC-1155, or similar.

- Scalability: Handles high transaction volumes efficiently.
- Low Fees: Affordable gas fees for minting and transferring NFTs (Polygon, Solana).

- Decentralized Storage: Integration with decentralized storage like IPFS for storing NFT metadata.

## Development of Smart-contracts
the main objectives will be

- Enable clients to mint NFT, and keep it private unless explicitly made public

- Defining The NFT structure and its metadata.(NFT is the proof for the rights of client over the charity act).

- Contracts for performing secure and transperant transactions

- Creating a owner status to all the assets, which is transferrable to desired peer on the network.

## Creating Marketplace
Features are Allowing users to view all different organisations and NFT's available 

Steps:

- Build the Marketplace on the selected blockchain network

- Faciliate transaction between peer nodes through De-centralized gatways

-  should adhere to token standards:

   - ERC-721: For unique, indivisible NFTs.
   - ERC-1155: For semi-fungible tokens (e.g., editions of an NFT).

- **Deploy the smart contracts into Marketplace**

## Create a custom wallet

- Create a wallet on selected blockchain network

- Choose the Development Stack:

  Languages: Use JavaScript, TypeScript, or Python for client-side wallet applications.

  Libraries:
  - Web3.js or Ethers.js: For interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
  - OpenZeppelin: For secure and reusable smart contract templates.
- Enable storing metadata locally ,without internet 

## Create a Dapp

- create a Dapp to host all services on internet, connecting different users.

## Fullstack
- Using Frameworks available, create a simple UI for users to use services interactively

- Create a backend to give functionality

- Create a Database and store metadata
